# PRRSV
## Requirements: 
### Packages
* R version 3.6+ 
* GSVA package 
* limma
* tidyverse
* GSEAbase
* sigPathway

## Aim

The goal of this project is to correlate early activation(day0, 3 , 7) of genesets of the innate immune system with later immune
 response (cellular and humoral) in the context of an infection with Porcine Reproductory and Respiratory syndrome virus.

## Experimental Setup

To test this hypothesis 24 pigs were separated in 4 groups : 
* Highly pathogenic strain
* Low pathogenic strain
* Vaccine 
* Mock
  
## Immune response in PRRSV
